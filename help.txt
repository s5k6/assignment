Synopsis:

    assi TUT=CAP ( TUT(=CAP)? )*  <  VOTES > RESULT

  where
       TUT : The name of a tutorial, use only ascii letters and digits.
       CAP : The integral capacity of the tutorial.  If omitted, reuse the
               capacity of the previous tutorial.
     VOTES : The file containing the student's preferences.
    RESULT : The file containing the resulting assignment.

The file VOTES contains the votes cast by the students.  Comments are of the
#-eol style.  Empty lines are ignored.  Other lines must have the following
form:

    NAME ( SPACE TUT ){0,n}

  where
    n is the number of tutorials given on the command line.
     NAME : The name of the student to be assigned
    SPACE : A whitespace, i.e., one of ` `, \t, \n, \0.
      TUT : The name of a tutorial given on the command line.

Students may cast up to n votes, in the order of descending preference.
Repeating a tutorial is not allowed.  The number of students is limited by the
total capacity.  If two students have the same name, you can't tell them apart
anyways.  Why bother?
